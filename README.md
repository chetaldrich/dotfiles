# .files


A repository to track my current configuration settings.

### Current Feature Set
Err...not much yet. I have my previous vim configuration file in the repo, and will change this accordingly once the install script and more configurations are added.

### TODO

#### Vim
1. HTML/HAML autocompletion
2. Rails configuration
3. Syntax checking
4. Surround mapping
5. More intelligent tabs?


If you would like to use the dotfiles,  run the following commands:

1. ```git clone https://github.com/chetaldrich/dotfiles```
2. ```chmod +x install.sh```
3. ```./install.sh```
