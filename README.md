# .files

A repository to track my current configuration settings.

### Current Feature Set
Currently installs and configures Vim, and some miscellaneous Mac configuration
files. More to come.

### TODO

#### Vim
1. HTML/HAML autocompletion
2. Rails configuration
3. Syntax checking
4. Surround mapping
5. More intelligent tabs?

If you would like to use the dotfiles,  run the following commands
(and make sure this project is in your home directory):

1. ```git clone https://github.com/chetaldrich/dotfiles```
2. ```chmod +x install.sh```
3. ```./install.sh```
