Vim Configuration
==================

This is a simple Vim configuration folder.
Currently has basic autocompletion and syntax highlighting,
and I'm working on adding some more features. 

TODO
------
1. HTML/HAML autocompletion
2. Rails configuration
3. Syntax checking
4. Surround mapping
5. More intelligent tabs?

If you would like to use it, clone the repository in your home directory, 
and then create a .vimrc in your home, and then type the following:

    runtime vimrc

And that should make everything work!
